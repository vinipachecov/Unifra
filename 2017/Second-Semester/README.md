# Second Semester 2017

## Databases II
This is a second discipline to improve basic SQL commands. We learn store procedures, indexes, triggers. The database used was Firebird.

The database used is in the folder to check what has been done.

## Databases III
More generic discipline to check more perspectives of datbases such as data-warehouses.
